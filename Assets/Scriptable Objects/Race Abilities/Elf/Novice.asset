    description: Starting with this character you get the normal d6Custom roll to
      determine how many points to use to upgrade stats, but on top of the number
      you get, this character gets 2 more. (if you rolled for 4 points, this character
      would get 2 more for a total of 6 points to use to upgrade stats)
